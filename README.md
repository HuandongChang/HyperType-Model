## Run the code

User first downloads all the files in the src fold to the same directory on your computer. Here are the introductions of each file:

##### initialization.py:

This file contains all the helper functions to initialize the HyperType model and part of the helper functions to initialize the Typing model. User should not run this file.

##### Regularinitialization.py:

This file contains the remaining helper functions to initialize the Typing model besides those existing in initialization.py. User should not run this file.

##### main.py:

We can adjust parameters, such as probability list and the number of triples, in main.py to generate graphs using the HyperType model. Besides, if the user wants to combine the HyperType model with the Typing model, user can include the function called initialization2D() in the file. Then user should use the terminal to run main.py (python main.py). Then the information of the output graph, such as the number of nodes and the number of edges, will be returned in the terminal.

![]()

##### parameter.py
